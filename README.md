Welcome to the indev branch ! We do not recommend you installing this branch mainly because it's likely to be full of error and innefficient code, but if you do however install the indev branch we do recommend some things:
- Please make sure it is up to date with the latest commits
- Please make sure to fill a issue if you test it out by yourself and encounter one
- Please never <b>ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever</b> put this branch on a production server, even if some features seems finished, it's more likely that they don't or are poorly made at the moment.

Please also make sure that if you do install the main branch on your server from this repo other than the Workshop addon to keep the addon up to date before complaining it's not working.

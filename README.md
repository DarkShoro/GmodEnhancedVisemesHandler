Hello and welcome to our GitHub page ! Here is where everything get packed up before an update, where everything is tested and also where everything get reported, this page is mainly for organisation purpose and you don't really need to be here unless you wanna make sure some malicious backdoor are in the code or if your just being curious (which is the first step to become programmer)

There is two branch currently in-use:
- The main branch:
where the source code equals the one on the workshop, no file is different and every hash should be the same (unless some errors gots in).
- The indev branch:
the most up to date of the two branches, this is the branch where we share stuff between us (me and Virtualraptor) and where everything gets tested and validated before being pushed to the main branch (pushing something into the main branch mean a update will come really soon)

We do not recommend download stuff from here, as it is mostly for developpement purpose only, if you just wanna try out the addon, go <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2729316709">Here</a> in order do download it.

If you do however install the indev branch we do recommend some things:
- Please make sure it is up to date with the latest commits
- Please make sure to fill a issue if you test it out by yourself and encounter one
- Please never <b>ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever</b> put this branch on a production server, even if some features seems finished, it's more likely that they don't or are poorly made at the moment.

Please also make sure that if you do install the main branch on your server from this repo other than the Workshop addon to keep the addon up to date before complaining it's not working.
